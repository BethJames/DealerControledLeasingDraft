Paul Sansone Jr has been an auto dealer since 1985. He was Director of Operations at Sansone Auto Network, a 26-acre complex including Toyota, Nissan, Hyundai, Mazda, Suzuki, and Lincoln Mercury from 1995 to 2009, and grew the dealership from 4,500 to 12,000 sales per year. Paul was also on the National Dealer Council for Mazda for 3 years including 2 years as President (1997-2001).
 </p>
<p>
In 2009, Paul bought from his father Sansone Jr's 66 Automall, which consists of a Nissan, Kia and Mitsubishi dealerships. He has since added an additional Nissan dealership with another Kia dealership on the way  His Nissan dealership has achieved the Nissan Award of Excellence seven years in a row and Kia has earned "Kia's Presidents Club"
 </p>
<p>
In 2010, Paul formed the PMB Group which includes Tier 4 Marketing EZ Referral Network and Dealer Controlled Leasing. Tier 4 Marketing and EZ Referral Network provides the technology and training for salespeople to market themselves under the dealership umbrella which benefit both parties and Dealer Controlled leasing provides the technology and training for a "Dealer Owned" subprime leasing company.
 </p>
<p> 
As a way of giving back to the community that supports Paul's dealership, he created "Hope for a Ride." Sansone Jr's 66 Automall partners with local organizations to donate vehicles to local families who, having a vehicle, would be life-changing. Whether it's being able to get to work, taking a family member to the hospital for on-going medical needs, or going to school to get a degree, Sansone Jr's 66 Automall is proud to support their community. A few months ago, one recipient was ready to purchase her first new car and she donated her "Hope for a Ride" vehicle to someone else in need.
 </p>
<p>
Paul has been married for over 30 years to Christine. His two sons work with him at the dealership and his daughter has recently graduated from College of Charleston. His wife Christine is also the spokesperson in all the radio and television commercials for the dealership. He's been a resident of Monmouth Beach for 35 years and during his day off you'll either find him hanging with this family at the beach or the golf course.

                     as permitted by law. Nonpublic, personal information, includes any information about you, that you or someone else

                  <p>A cookie is a small text file containing information that a website stores on your computer&#39;s hard drive so the

                     to personalize information for visitors and by storing information about user preferences on a particular site so that
                     the user does not have to re-enter information each time he or she returns to the site. Many websites such as Mycarafc.com
